Match.py 
Main controller that everything runs through
Tracks everything

On starts _ setup.py
SPlits position number from json into squad number (sn) and role number (rn)
sn is what is displayed on the 2d node and rn governs what position the player aftually plays

team class (name , squad list, tactics)
mainly referential for what team is in possession etc for now
will be used later for tactics etc
but there is team a and team b sjhown as vars a and b for simplicity

player (name,sn,rn , loaction [3d] attributes (hiiden & normal) height, weight)

ball (loaction, holder)
holder is determined by a code of sn & team code
e.g 15a will mean the balls position is locked to teh position of sn 15 on team a 

pitch (game environment)
dimensions are horziontal pitch
trylines at 0,100
touchlines are 0, 70
play is allowed to spill out pver this but the platyers and ball are both out of bounds
deadball line is at -10, 110
co-ordiobnates for 3d is (0,0,X)
this allows players to jump for balls and teh ball to be kivked in attributes
The co-ordinates are in meteres so floats will be used to tarck players precise details for higher accuracy


states,  events that trigger desicion making and specific positioning
pks (punts or goalkicks)
tap & gos, (quick and set plays)
scrums, 
mauls,
lineouts,
rucks,
kick return,
turnover,
restarts

actions
Anything a player with the ball  will fall into one of these categories in open play

pass,
kick,
enter contact,
catch, 
run,

desicions - determine the path they choose
at every tick every player has a variety of options to choose from  (mental)
and theior attributes determine the outcome that arises form tehir desicion (mental and physical, techinical

Players shouldf take into acciunt several factors when positioning themselves:
Game state.
WHo is in possession (team)
and their rn
in attack 
forwards should look to make arrow shapes off the ruck or off 10 
9 shpould always aim to be at the ruck to pass the ball but not look to enter the ruck 
10 should be 5,5 away from teh ruck (keeping in mind picth orientation and dire ction of play

In defense forwards should go near the ruck spacing ..5 away from ruck first then 1m than 2, then everyone elses spaces 3m out in a line

rn 15 takes postion on the same y axis as the ball but at a median point ebtween the ball and his tryline on the x axis 

It is paramount to avoid confusin that there is as little dupliaction of variables as possible so we can have a fluid lean system
