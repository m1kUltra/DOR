A. Player Context Layer (Static & Dynamic State)

Each player has a base profile (attributes  listed).

Dynamic state includes: current condition %,
 morale/pressure, position on pitch, current role (carrier, support, tackler), and situational modifiers (fatigue (impacted by stamina & ball in play time and actions in phase ), injuries, momentum, weather).


 morale and pressure is determined by hidden attribuets tempremenat and pressure and teamwork determination
 Mood Name	Description	Likely Causes	Gameplay Impacts (examples)
 Note moods are handled by a different function as outlined further down in mood_controller spec{}
🔥 Fired Up	Highly motivated, aggressive	Big team talk, derby match, leading well	+Aggression, +Work Rate, more dominant tackles and carries
😠 Frustrated	Angry after repeated mistakes or ref calls	Poor calls, losing badly	+Aggression (riskier tackles), −Decisions, −Composure (more penalties)
🧊 Calm	Steady, unfazed	High Temperament, low pressure situations	+Concentration, +Composure, consistent skill execution
🤯 Anxious	Feeling the pressure, hesitant	Big final, low Pressure attribute	−Composure, −Decisions, −Goal Kicking accuracy
😤 Determined	Gritting teeth through adversity	High Determination, comeback situation	+Work Rate, +Rucking, +Tackle success even when fatigued
😎 Confident	Believes they can dominate	Good recent form, early try	+Flair (will attempt more creative plays), +Technique
🫣 Rattled	Shaken by errors or dominant opponents	Low Temperament, big hits	−Passing, −Handling, panic kicks
🪫 Flat	Low energy or demotivated	Losing streak, low morale	−Work Rate, −Teamwork, less effective support running
🤝 Selfless	Prioritises team over self	High Teamwork, good morale	+Teamwork effects (more support lines, ruck support), −Flair (fewer individual risks)
🤬 Reckless	Overly aggressive, not thinking	High Aggression + Frustration	+Tackle dominance, but +Dirtiness (more cards), −Decisions
. 
Attribute	Mood Effect Example
Passing	A player in “Anxious” mood might have −10% effective Passing and −5% Handling (hurried throws).
Aggression	“Fired Up” or “Reckless” gives +10% Aggression → more dominant tackles, but higher chance of conceding penalties (Dirtiness check).
Composure	“Anxious” −20% Composure → Goal Kicking suffers, pressured passes more likely to fail.
Work Rate	“Determined” +15% Work Rate → player covers more ground, more ruck involvements.
Flair	“Confident” +15% Flair → attempts offloads and tricky passes, leading to spectacular breaks or costly turnovers.
Teamwork	“Selfless” +10% Teamwork → more likely to hit rucks, run dummy/support lines.
Technique	“Calm” +5% Technique → executes skills smoothly under pressure.


Attribute Category	Fatigue Impact	Condition Impact	Description
Physical	✅ Strong	✅ Strong	Speed, strength, agility all drop noticeably.
Technical	✅ Moderate	✅ Moderate	Passing, handling, goal kicking, offloading get sloppier.
Mental (Concentration, Decisions, Composure)	✅ Strong	☑️ Some	Fatigue causes rushed decisions, mental errors, defensive lapses.
Hidden/Behavioral (Bravery, Aggression)	☑️ Slight	❌ None	Players may “choose” easier options when fatigued.
Set-piece Specific (e.g., Scrummaging, Lineouts)	✅ Moderate	✅ Moderate	Form and timing break down under fatigue.

Fatigue starts is effected by where condition is it get resets to the upper limit that condition is at 

Impact of collisions - Standard is 3 , dominant 1 boosts resolve , being dominated is 8, 
Impact of set piece - ruck jackaling or sealing off is 1 . being cleared out is 3/6 for dominant clear out, Counter rucks contest is determined by time of ruck in seconds by (0.25) until ruck contest is over
maul (0.25) until maul is over  in seconds
scrums initial bind is 8
scrum (0.25) until scrum is over in seconds 

kicking - no effect

running 1m = 0.1 per m * speed/attribute.pace

 
condition = condition - fatigue/(stamina*10)
fatigue reset to 0 at each break in play
condition = condition +natural fitness (@halftime) and 
condition = condition +(natural fitness)/2 (@yellowcard) or subbed off 
if fatigue >= condition:
    player.exhausted = True

)
condition = min(condition, 100)
Attribute Group	Max Fatigue Penalty	Max Condition Penalty	Notes
Physical (pace, accel, strength, agility)	−30% @ fatigue 100	−25% @ condition 0	Core physicality degrades steeply
Technical (passing, handling, goal_kicking, offloading)	−20%	−20%	Mild degradation with sloppier output
Mental (decisions, concentration, composure)	−30%	−15%	Strong short-term effect from fatigue, less from long-term drain
Hidden/Behavioral (bravery, aggression)	−10%	0%	Fatigue nudges decisions safer, but no real stat drop
Set Piece Specific (scrummaging, lineouts, technique)	−20%	−20%	Worsens both with fatigue and declining reserve

westher, these can be combined and scaled 
Weather Type	Effects
Clear	No effect
Rain	More knock-ons, lower handling, slower ground speed
Wet ground	Lower footing = worse balance, agility, more slips
Windy	Kicking accuracy drops (goal_kicking, touch finders)
Hot	Fatigue accumulates faster
Cold	Minor stiffness: −acceleration, −agility early in match


Momentum is a match state that can boost performance for a team (or suppress it).
it doesn not get reset and is present for the whole game but only remembers the last 10 minutes 
🛠️ Momentum Triggers
Gained by:

Scoring a try + 10

Forcing a turnover + 5

Huge defensive stand (Opposing team eneters within 20 metres but acheives no points) = 10

Big dominant hit or linebreak (+5)

Lost by:

Conceding penalty (-5)

Missed tackle → try
repeated knock-ons erors lossing possession (-5), -15 in opposing 22 or your own
 or kick to touch os less than 10 metres and is in not in opposing teams 22 - 15

🎚️ Momentum Meter (−100 to +100)
0 = neutral

+100 = max boost for one team, −100 for the other

🧠 Effect of Momentum

+momentum effecs mood of players 
mood_controller 
governed by Base traits (temperament, pressure, teamwork, determination, aggression)
anxiety - confidence axis (governed by momentum) debuffs are negated by pressure 
frustrated- calm axis (governed by penalty count and scoreline and number of drop balls) debuffs negated by composure and exarcebated by temperament
flat-motivated axis (effected by scoreline within and match importance) improved by aggression and teamwork and workrate
debuffs negated by teamwork and workrate

All players on a team have the same base for axis  but how their mental attributes arew eighted detremined their current mood

Mood	Confidence	Stability	Motivation
🔥 Fired Up	High	Mid	High
😠 Frustrated	Mid	Low	Mid
🧊 Calm	Mid	High	Mid
🤯 Anxious	Low	Mid	High (often anxious energy)
😤 Determined	Mid	High	High
😎 Confident	High	High	High
🫣 Rattled	Low	Low	Mid
🪫 Flat	Low	Mid	Low
🤝 Selfless	Mid	High	Mid
🤬 Reckless	High	Low	High


injuries are detrmined by a players  Injury proness (condition- fatigue ) 
this occurs when aplayer undertakes a collison or a sprint at max pace with a rand operator for variance
Injuroes efefect the relevant place head leg etc depending on the casue of Injury
These are located in the sql table injuries and injury causes


B. Decision Layer (Mental/Tactical AI)

Decides what action a player will attempt (pass, run, kick, offload, clearout, tackle type, etc.).

Driven by attributes like:
decisions, anticipation, vision, leadership, teamwork, aggression, flair, off_the_ball, positioning.

Layer B is dtermined by a player having options available and them choosing the correct one



C. Action Layer (Execution & Resolution)

Simulates how well the chosen action is performed.

Driven by technical & physical attributes relevant to the action, with situational modifiers (pressure, fatigue):

e.g. Passing resolution = function(passing, handling, composure, concentration, pressure).

D. Contest Layer (Opposition Interaction)

Resolves opposed actions: tackle vs footwork, lineout jumper vs defender, jackal vs clearout.

Uses attributes from both players (strength, balance, footwork, aggression, bravery, technique).

E. Outcome Layer (Game State Update)

Updates ball location, possession, score events, injuries, cards, stamina drains.

Feeds back into player context layer.

Decision Phase

For ball carrier: choose action (run, pass, kick, offload) using weighted AI (decisions, vision, anticipation, teamwork).

For defenders: choose tackle type/mark assignment.

For support players: choose support line, ruck involvement.

Execution Phase

Roll skill checks: action attribute ± modifiers (fatigue, pressure, technique).

Opposed checks where relevant (e.g., footwork vs tackling).

Outcome Resolution

Update ball position, metres gained, turnovers.

Apply stamina cost, injuries (injury proneness + impact), potential cards (dirtiness).

Set-piece/Restart Resolution

Scrums, lineouts, kickoffs processed similarly with relevant attributes.

Repeat until match ends

✨ Other Implementation Notes
Attribute Interactions:
Use primary and supplemental attributes. For example:

Technique as a global multiplier: if high, small bonus to all technical skills.

Composure and Pressure as situational modifiers for kicks/passes in high-stress moments.

Consistency & Important Matches: pre-match roll to modify attributes (±5–10%).

Physics Layer 
For more realism, you could simulate collisions using mass weight, strength, acceleration, and balance in a simple physics formula.
