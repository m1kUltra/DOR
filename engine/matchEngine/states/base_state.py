each action or event(new) has its own status tag and the player and the location of event

"""events are concept in order to remove the blackhole caused by using a ball based fsm. essentially reducing the need for states to 
need to trigger each other or ever interact with each other as that is messy
try event penalty_given scrum-called etc
these are essentially anything done by a referee blowing there whistle and saves the ball having to worry 
about adavantage etc as that is handled by other modules"""
