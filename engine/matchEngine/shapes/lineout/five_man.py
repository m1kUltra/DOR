"""Template lineout shape for a five-man attacking lineout.

The returned layout uses a local coordinate system with ``+x`` pointing
infield from the touch line and ``+y`` running toward the top touchline.
Positions are supplied for both the attacking side (``team_a``) and the
defensive side (``team_b``), the latter mirrored around the line with a
1.5m gap.
Only the attacking side's positions are generated; callers can mirror the
layout for the defence if required.
